We saw that density operators can describe both pure states (i.e. those that could be described also by a ket) and mixed states. We then used this new description to describe bipartite entanglement._\n",

This model of quantum measurements is the most general one available also to quantum mechanics researchers. We will put it into practice by simulating quantum tomography (i.e. finding out the state of a system by repeated measurements)._\n",

    "# 1. Probability operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Any quantum state can be measured, to gather information about it. In Lecture 2 we have seen _projective_ measurements, now we will see _generalized_ measurements. They are usually called POVMs (Positive Operator-Valued Measures) or POMs (Probability Operator Measures). I like the second acronym better, because it reminds us the meaning of the operators, but note that the first is far more popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 The idea\n",
    "The idea is pretty much the same as for projectors: a measurement is a process with a number of outcomes that occur probabilistically. The role of projectors was to represent the outcomes, and their expectation value was the probability of that outcome. It turns out that projectors are not the most general objects with this property, we can in fact generalize a set of projectors to a set of generic _probability operators_. The difference is simple, we simply drop one of the requirements that apply to projectors. Let's first review them:\n",
    "\n",
    "The projectors representing a measurement have the following 4 properties:\n",
    "1. They are Hermitian: $P = P^\\dagger$\n",
    "2. They are positive semidefinite (non-negative eigenvalues) $P\\geq 0$\n",
    "3. They are complete: $\\sum_iP_i=\\mathbb{1}$\n",
    "4. They are mutually orthogonal: $P_iP_j= \\delta_{ij}P_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "General probability operators share all of the above properties __except the last one__: they don't need to be orthogonal to each other. And this makes sense: measurment results could give us overlapping information."
