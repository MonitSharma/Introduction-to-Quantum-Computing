    "_In Lecture 2 we saw how to model Measurements (the second pillar of QM). We think of a measurement as an orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space of the system, where each vector in the basis corresponds to a possible outcome. The actual outcome that we obtain is random, and it follows the probability distribution given by the absolute value squared of the coefficients of the state vector written in this basis. The measurement collapses the state vector of the system onto the basis element corresponding to the result, and no trace of the previous state is left. Given the correspondence beween bases and measurements, we use Hermitian matrices to represent Observable quantities. The idea is to use the eigenbasis of the matrix as the basis for the measurement of that Observable. Then we could think of the eigenvalues as simply the numerical quantities associated with the outcomes (which allows us for examples to include measurement units). Finally, we associated each element of the basis to a projector onto that eigenspace. This allows us to treat projectors as \"probability operators\", as their expectation value is the probability of obtainin that outcome._\n",

Our goal today is to express unitary transformations in a clever and useful way, and to include the transformation of a qubit and the time-evolution as particular, but very important cases._\n",

So the action on an element $|v_i\\rangle$ of the eigenbasis of $M$ is simply to rotate its phase by an angle that depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ and on $\\epsilon$:\n",

This is a convenient simplification, so what is left is to rememeber that the units of $\\hbar$ are [Energy$\\cdot$Time].

    "Writing a Hamiltonian is an important thing to know. Once we have the Hamiltonian, we can compute the time evolution operator and with that we can fast-forward time and rewind the clock on any quantum state!\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to begin from the role of the Hamiltonian as the Observable of energy. Energy in mechanical systems (like a particle in a box) comes in two forms: kinetic and potential: $H = H_\\mathrm{kinetic} - H_\\mathrm{potential}$. Classically, the kinetic energy can be written as\n",

    "Where $P$ is the momentum and $m$ is the mass of the particle (which is just a numerical parameter). So in order to write the kinetic contribution to the Hamiltonian, we need the momentum Observable. What is the momentum observable? To answer this question we need to go back for a second to the fact that position and momentum are continuous quantities, and their Observable are actually defined in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This is very convenient because in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space we can do calculus (integrals, derivatives and so on). In fact, those are our only tools to define operators (which in that case cannot be matrices, because the space is infinite-dimensional).\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we'll do is we will find the momentum Observable $P$ with a trick. First of all, we'll need something that contains $P$. Luckily we know that the unitary operator that shifts the position of a particle is generated by the momentum Observable:\n",

This is simpler than one may think: a derivative is the limit for $\\delta x\\rightarrow 0$ of $$\\frac{\\psi(x + \\delta x) - \\psi(x)}{\\delta x}$$ In a discrete space though, we can't have $\\delta x$ go all the way to zero! It will have to shrink at most to the size of the smallest interval. But then $\\psi(x+\\delta x)$ and $\\psi(x)$ are two amplitudes that are next to each other in the discrete space.

It will simply be a diagonal matrix with the value of the potential $V(x)$ at the discrete position $x$. A box with solid boundaries has zero potential inside and infinite potential outside. So for us it's trivial to implement the walls of the box: they correspond to the first and last index! Our quantum state is guaranteed to stay in the box because there are no indices to describe positions outside of it! So here's our Hamiltonian:\n",
