# Course Schedule
We will majorly focus on quantum algorithms in this version of the course.

### Week 1: Introduction
It includes topics like:

  #### 1. Quantum Information Science : quantum theory + computer science + information theory 
  What is quantum information science? What is it composed of? Various branches of it, like Quantum sensing, quantum cryptography, quantum networking, etc.
  
  #### 2. Frontiers of Physics
  What are the major breakthroughs in physics, and at what scale do we study them? Where does quantum information science lie among them?
  
  #### 3. Quantum Entanglement
  Analogy by book. Nearly all the information in a typical entangled “quantum book” is encoded in the correlations among the “pages”. You can't access the information if you read the book one page at a time.
  
  
  #### 4. Why we think quantum computing is powerful?
  Problems believed to be hard classically, which are easy for quantum computers. Factoring is the best known example and Complexity theory arguments indicating that quantum computers are hard to simulate classically.
  
  
  
  #### 5. Decoherence
  Decoherenceexplains why quantum phenomena, though observable in the microscopic systems studied in the physics lab, are not manifest in the macroscopic physical systems that we encounter in our ordinary experience.
  
  
  #### 6. Qubit
  A vector (actually a “ray” because the normalization is 1 by convention, and the overall phase does not matter) in a two dimensional complex Hilbert space.
  
  
  #### 7. What quantum computational supermacy means?
  An impressive achievement in experimental physics and a testament to ongoing progressin building quantum computing hardware.
We have arguably entered the regime where the extravagant exponential resources of the quantum world can be validated.
  
  #### 8. Quantum computing in NISQ era
  The (noisy) 50-100 qubit quantum computer has arrived.
(NISQ= noisy intermediate-scale quantum.)
NISQ devices cannot be simulated by brute force using the most powerful currently existing supercomputers.
Noise limits the computational power of NISQ-era technology.
  
  #### 9. Hybrid quantum/ classical optimizers
  We don’t expect a quantum computer to solve worst case instances of NP-hard problems, but it mightfind better approximate solutions, or find them faster.
Classical optimization algorithms (for both classical and quantum problems)
  
  #### 10. The era of quantum heuristics
  Sometimes algorithms are effective in practice even though theorists are not able to validate their performance in advance.
Example: Deep learning. Mostly tinkering so far, without much theory input.
  
  #### 11. Information vs Disturbance
  What can we measure and what can't we mwasure without disturbing the state?
  
  
  #### 12. Tensor Product
  How to distinguish two subsystems?
  
  
  
  
  
.... work on progress.
